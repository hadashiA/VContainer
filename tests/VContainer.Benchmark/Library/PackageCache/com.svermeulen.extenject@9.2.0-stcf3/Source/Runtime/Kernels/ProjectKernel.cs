        // is that the order that OnDestroy is called in is difficult to predict
        // One good thing is that it does follow the heirarchy order (so root game objects
        // will have thier OnDestroy called before child objects)
        // However, the order that OnDestroy is called for the root game objects themselves
        // is largely random
        // Within an individual scene, this can be helped somewhat by placing all game objects
        // underneath the SceneContext and then also checking the 'ParentNewObjectsUnderRoot'
        // property to ensure any new game objects will also be parented underneath SceneContext
        // By doing this, we can be guaranteed to have any bound IDisposable's have their
        // Dispose called before any game object is destroyed in the scene
        // However, when using multiple scenes (each with their own SceneContext) the order
        // that these SceneContext game objects are destroyed is random
        // So to address that, we explicitly call GameObject.DestroyImmediate for all
        // SceneContext's in the reverse order that the scenes were loaded in below
        // (this works because OnApplicationQuit is always called before OnDestroy)
        // Note that this only works when stopping the app and not when changing scenes
        // When changing scenes, if you have multiple scenes loaded at once, you will have to
        // manually unload the scenes in the reverse order they were loaded before going to
