title: Hello World
---

The basic way for integrating VContainer into your application is:

- Create a component that inherits `LifetimeScope` in your scene. It has one container and one scope.
- Register dependencies with C# code in a subclass of LifetimeScope. This is the composition root.
- When playing scene, LifetimeScope automatically build Container and dispatch to the own PlayerLoopSystem.

:::note
Normally, a "scope" is repeatedly created and destroyed during the game. `LifetimeScope` assumes this and has a parent-child relationship.
:::

**1. Write a class that depends on other classes**

Let's say Hello world.

```csharp title="HelloWorldService.cs"
namespace MyGame
{
    public class HelloWorldService
    {
        public void Hello()
        {
            UnityEngine.Debug.Log("Hello world");
        }
    }
}
```

**2. Define composition root**

Next, let's write a setting that can auto-wiring the class.

- Right click in a folder within the Project Tab and Choose **Create -> C# Script**.
- Name it `GameLifetimeScope.cs`.

:::note
VContainer will automatically a template for C# scripts ending in *LifetimeScope.
:::

You instruct `builder` and register the class above.

```diff title="GameLifetimeScope.cs"
using VContainer;
using VContainer.Unity;

namespace MyGame
{
    public class GameLifetimeScope : LifetimeScope
    {
        protected override void Configure(IContainerBuilder builder)
        {
+            builder.Register<HelloWorldService>(Lifetime.Singleton);
        }
    }
}
```

:::note
VContainer always requires a `Lifetime` argument explicitly. This gives us transparency and consistency.
:::

**3. Create GameObject attached your LifetimeScope**

Right Click inside the Hierarchy tab and select **Create Empty**. And name `GameLifetimeScope` it.

Then attach the Component created above.

**4. How to use your new HelloWorldService  ?**

Registered objects will automatically have dependency injection.
Like below:

```csharp title="GamePresenter.cs"
using VContainer;
using VContainer.Unity;

namespace MyGame
{
    public class GamePresenter
    {
        readonly HelloWorldService helloWorldService;

        public GamePresenter(HelloWorldService helloWorldService)
        {
            this.helloWorldService = helloWorldService;
        }
    }
}
```

And let's also register this class.

```diff
builder.Register<HelloWorldService>(Lifetime.Singleton);
+ builder.Register<GamePresenter>(Lifetime.Singleton);
```

**5. Execute your registerd object on PlayerLoopSystem**

To write an application in Unity, we have to interrupt Unity's lifecycle events.
(Typically MonoBehaviour's Start / Update / OnDestroy / etc..)

Objects registered with VContainer can do this independently of MonoBehaviour.
This is done automatically by implementing and registering some marker interfaces.

```diff title="GamePresenter.cs"
using VContainer;
using VContainer.Unity;

 namespace MyGame
 {
-    public class GamePresenter
+    public class GamePresenter : ITickable
     {
         readonly HelloWorldService helloWorldService;

         public GamePresenter(HelloWorldService helloWorldService)
         {
             this.helloWorldService = helloWorldService;
         }

+        void ITickable.Tick()
+        {
+            helloWorldService.Hello();
+        }
     }
 }
```

Now, `Tick()` will be executed at the timing of Unity's Update.

As such, it's a good practice to keep any side effect entry points through the marker interface.  

(By design, for MonoBehaviour is enough to use Start / Update etc. The marker interface of VContainer is a function to separate the entry point of domain logic and presentation logic. )

We should register this as running on Unity's life cycle events.

```diff title="GameLifetimeScope.cs"
- builder.Register<GamePresenter>(Lifetime.Singleton);
+ builder.RegisterEntryPoint<GamePresenter>();
```

:::note
- RegisterEntryPoint&lt;GamePresenter&gt;() is an alias to register interfaces related to Unity's PlayerLoop event.
    - Similar to Register&lt;GamePresenter&gt;(Lifetime.Singleton).As&lt;ITickable&gt;()
- Registering lifecycle events without relying on MonoBehaviour facilitates decoupling of domain logic and presentation !
:::

If you have multiple EntryPoints, you can also use the following declaration as grouping.

```csharp title="GameLifetimeScope.cs"
builder.UseEntryPoints(Lifetime.Singleton, entryPoints =>
{
    entryPoints.Add<GamePresenter>();
    // entryPoints.Add<OtherSingletonEntryPointA>();
    // entryPoints.Add<OtherSingletonEntryPointB>();
    // entryPoints.Add<OtherSingletonEntryPointC>();
})
```

This makes it clearer that EntryPoints are given special treatment by design.

**6. Inversion of Control (IoC)**

It typically calls logic in response to events such as user input. 

Consider the following View Component.

```csharp title="HelloScreen.cs"

using UnityEngine.UI;
public class HelloScreen : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Button HelloButton;
}
```

In normal Unity programming, you embed logic calls in HelloScreen, but if you're using DI, you can separate HelloScreen and   any control flow.

```diff  title="GamePresenter.cs"
namespace MyGame
{
-    public class GamePresenter : ITickable
+    public class GamePresenter : IStartable
     {
         readonly HelloWorldService helloWorldService;
+        readonly HelloScreen helloScreen;  

         public GamePresenter(
             HelloWorldService helloWorldService,
+            HelloScreen helloScreen)
         {
             this.helloWorldService = helloWorldService;
+            this.helloScreen = helloScreen;
         }

+        void IStartable.Start()
+        {
+            helloScreen.HelloButton.onClick.AddListener(() => helloWorldService.Hello());
+        }
     }    
}
```

By doing this, we succeeded in separating the domain logic / control flow / view component.

- **GamePresenter:** Responsible only for Control Flow.
- **HelloWorldService:** Responsible only for the functionality that can be called anytime, anywhere
- **HelloScreen**: Responsible only for View.

In VContainer, you need to register the dependent MonoBehaviour. Don't forget to register HelloScreen.

```diff  title="GameLifetimeScope.cs"
    public class GameLifetimeScope : LifetimeScope
    {
+       [SerializeField]
+       HelloScreen helloScreen;

        protected override void Configure(IContainerBuilder builder)
        {
            builder.RegisterEntryPoint<GamePresenter>();
            builder.Register<HelloWorldService>(Lifetime.Singleton);
+           builder.RegisterComponent(helloScreen);
        }
    }
```
