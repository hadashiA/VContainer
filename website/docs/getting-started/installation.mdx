Here's how you can get started with using VContainer.

:::note
*VContainer requires Unity 2018.4 or later.*
:::

### Install via OpenUPM

VContainer is available on the [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/packages/jp.hadashikick.vcontainer) package registry. This is the preferred method of installation, as you can easily receive updates as they're released.

If you have [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli) installed, then run the following command in your project's directory:

```
openupm add jp.hadashikick.vcontainer
```

If you don't want to use `openupm-cli` (or if you're hosting VContainer on an alternative registry), you can manually add it to your project's `manifest.json` by modifying the `scopedRegistries` and `dependencies` fields:

```json title="Packages/manifest.json"
{
  "scopedRegistries": [
    {
      "name": "package.openupm.com",
      "url": "https://package.openupm.com",
      "scopes": [
        "jp.hadashikick.vcontainer"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "jp.hadashikick.vcontainer": "1.14.0"
  }
}
```

### Install via UPM (using Git URL)

Navigate to your project's `Packages` folder and open the `manifest.json` file. Then add this package somewhere in the `dependencies` block:

```json title="Packages/manifest.json"
      "jp.hadashikick.vcontainer": "https://github.com/hadashiA/VContainer.git?path=VContainer/Assets/VContainer#1.15.4",
```

UPM should now install the package. This is useful if you're maintaining a fork of VContainer for your own project but don't want to set up a private registry.

### Install manually (using .unitypackage)

Download the latest `.unitypackage` from the [releases](https://github.com/hadashiA/VContainer/releases) page and open it within your project. Install it as you would for any other package.
