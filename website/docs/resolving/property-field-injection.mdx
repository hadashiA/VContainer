title: Property/Field Injection
---

Dependencies can be injected into properties or fields as well. To do so, annotate each property or field that represents a dependency with `[Inject]`.

```csharp
class ClassA
{
    [Inject]
    IServiceA serviceA { get; set; }
    
    [Inject]
    IServiceB serviceB;

    public ClassA()
    {
    }
}
```

Injection via properties or fields is a helpful alternative to [method injection](./method-injection).

## Property/Field Injection with Keys

When you have multiple implementations of the same interface or type registered with different keys, you can use the `Key` attribute along with `Inject` to specify which implementation to inject:

```csharp
class WeaponHolder
{
    [Inject, Key(WeaponType.Primary)]
    public IWeapon PrimaryWeapon { get; set; }
    
    [Inject, Key("orc")]
    public IEnemy OrcEnemy { get; set; }
    
    [Inject, Key(2)]
    ILevel nextLevel;
}
```

:::note
When using keys with property or field injection, you must use both the `Inject` and `Key` attributes. The `Key` attribute alone is not sufficient for property or field injection.

:::note
The `Key` attribute must be used with types that have been registered with the corresponding key using the `.Keyed()` method. See the [Register with Keys](../registering/register-type#register-with-keys) section for more information.
