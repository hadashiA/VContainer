## Container Build Callbacks

You can register any arbitrary action to happen at container build time by registering a build callback.

```cs
builder.RegisterBuildCallback(container =>
{
    var serviceA = container.Resolve<ServiceA>();
    var serviceB = container.Resolve<ServiceB>();
    // ...
});
```

- We can use `IObjectResolver` as a callback argument.
- For more information about `IObjectResolver`, see [Contaienr API](../resolving/container-api)
